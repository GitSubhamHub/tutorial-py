#python has around 8 types of operators
#basically we use operators to perform certain actions or calculations.
#===========================
    #Arithmetic operators (+,-,*,/,%)
    #Assignment operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %= )
    #Comparison operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <= )
    #Logical Operators (and, or, not)
    #Identity operators (is, is not)
    #Membership Operators (in, not in)
    #Bitwise operators


#arithmetic operators
print(10+35)
print(200-45)
print(30*20)


#assignmet operators
x = 10
y = 15
z = x
print(z)

x = 10
# x = x + 10
x += 10
print(x)

# x = x - 5
x -= 5
print(x)

# x = x*15
x *= 15
print(x)


#comparison operators 
print(10==20)
print(10 > 20)
print(10 < 20)
print(10 <= 20)
print(10 >= 20)


#logical operators
print(10<20 and 10<15)
print(10>20 and 10<30)
print(10>20 or 10<30)
